# These helper functions are used in most of the
# job scripts.  They help determine the filenames
# of the jobs so that HiTSAPipe can determine if
# everything finished properly.

# These scripts rely on specific variables being
# set.
#
# Required:
#	JOB_STATUS_DIR
#	PBS_JOBNAME
#	RETVAL
#	SUCCESS_FILE
#	FAILURE_FILE
# Optional:
#	PBS_O_ARRAYID
#	ERROR_MSG
#	TO_LOG

# RETVAL, SUCCESS_FILE, FAILURE_FILE, TO_LOG and 
# ERROR_MSG must be the variables used in the job 
# scripts in order for everything to work properly.
# PBS_JOBNAME and PBS_O_ARRAYID will be set by
# qsub if running in parallel, otherwise HiTSAPipe
# will mimic these variables if running in
# standalone.  PBS_O_ARRAYID will only be set
# if the job is an array job however.
# JOB_STATUS_DIR is a static variable set by
# HiTSAPipe
